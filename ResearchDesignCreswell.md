# Workflow of Research
1) Decide on worldview
2) Decide on design
3) Decide on methods
4) *Make a planned flowchart* (general literature review)
5) collect relevant articles (make an annotated bibliography)
7) Pick an angle (find a gap)
8) 

# Research Components
## Research Approaches
Three components (worldview, design, methods)
### Worldviews
In proposals, declare worldview as position you take
* post-positivism
Cause and effect, quantitative focus
* constructivism
Social construct, looking at societal items as fabricated objects
* Transformative/critical
Targets roots of oppression
* Pragmatism
What practically works, practical solutions
### Research Designs
* Quantitative
Surveys, experimental
* Qualitative
Narrative, phenomenological, grounded, ethnography, case studies
* Mixed
Qualitative then quantitative (exploratory sequential), quantitative then qualitative (explanatory sequential), simultaneous (convergent mixed)
### Methods
* Quantitative - pre-determined, instrument-based, stat analysis
* Qualitative - methods made up along the way, open-ended questions, text + image themes/patterns
## Research Problem and Questions
* Quantitative - id of influencing factors, utility of an intervention, finding good predictors
* Qualitative - when you do not know best variables to examine
* Mixed - a mix of both to make an accurate and definitive conclusion generalizable (power of RCT, generalizability of ethnography)
## Literature Review
### Topic Selection
* describe in short phrase/few words
* draft a working title
"My Study is about ..." fill in blank
Avoid using "A study of ..." in title (we know this is a study)
Pose topic as brief question
CAN this be studied?
* if you have the means to collect data (willing participants, etc.)
SHOULD this be studied?
* does this ADD or REPLICATE to extant knowledge?
* does this lift marginalized voices, addresses injustices, transforms beliefs of researcher
## Picking an Angle
* what niche has the literature not covered yet? Rural, minorities, treatments
## Literature review
* 20-30 pages of basic literature topics (group under headings for each bubble in the map)
* 4 types: integrate what others have done, critique current literature, link topics, identify issues in field.
* Make a subsection called "review literature" or something
### Running the actual search
* identify key words
* target appropriate databases
* aim for 50 papers
* skim these 50 papers, save the ones that are relevant
* make a literature map
* summarize each article, make a reference of each article (a working bibliography)
* organize into topics and themes
* search specific and adjacent databases
* use database thesaurus to expand key words
*

# Chapter Ending Exercises
## Chapter I
1) Idntify a research question in a journal article and discuss what approach would be best to study the question and why.
2) Take a topic that you would like to stidy, and using the four combinations of worldview (worldview selection), designs and methods, discuss a project that brings together a worldview, designs, and methods. Identify whether this would be quantitative, quantitative, or mixed methods research. Use the typical scenarios that we have advanced in this chapter as a guide.
3) What distinguishes an quantitative stud from a qualitative study? Mention three charactersics.
